# realm-recyclerview-lite

realm-recyclerview-lite is an implementation of a RecyclerView which supports Realm data.  
It is intended to be a slim library which fulfills the functionality requirements I have for my open source Android app [Minerva][Minerva]; no more, no less.  
However, I figured I might as well release it as a library in case others had similar use cases to mine.

If you just want to know what's new, [the changelog is here][CHANGELOG].

Please be sure to take a moment to look at the [Origin][Origin] section. You'll find a link to Thorben Primke's [realm-recyclerview][RRV] library, which this library is a heavily reworked derivative of.

## Installation
Including realm-recyclerview-lite in your app is pretty simple, just make sure that you have the following in your root `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

And then add this to your app's `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile ('com.bkromhout:realm-recyclerview-lite:{latest version}@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
}
```
Please note that at this time, realm-recyclerview-lite has been tested and is verified to work with **Realm 0.88.3**. Don't be afraid to try a newer version of Realm, just be sure to open an issue if you run into problems.

**realm-recyclerview-lite is compatible with Android API Levels >= 11.**

## Usage
Adding a `RealmRecyclerView` to your layout is simple:
```xml
<RelativeLayout
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/recycler"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
</RelativeLayout>
```

The other important thing is to make sure that your adapter extends `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`. In keeping with the provided sample application, here is (a very slimmed down) version of an adapter:
```java
public class ItemAdapter extends RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter<Item, ItemAdapter.ItemVH> {

    public ItemAdapter(Context context, RealmResults<Item> realmResults) {
        super(context, realmResults, true, true, null);
        setHasStableIds(true);
    }

    @Override
    public long getItemId(int position) {
        return realmResults.get(position).uniqueId;
    }

    @Override
    public ItemVH onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        return new ItemVH(inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_card, parent, false));
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(final ItemVH holder, int position) {
        Item item = realmResults.get(position);
        holder.name.setText(item.name);
    }

    static class ItemVH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        @Bind(R.id.content)
        RelativeLayout content;
        @Bind(R.id.name)
        TextView name;

        public ItemVH(View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            ButterKnife.bind(this, itemView);
        }
    }
}
```

If you look at the actual [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class], you'll notice that there are many other things present in it. We'll get to those as we discuss the features, this is meant to be a bare-bones example implementation.

To set your adapter to a `RealmRecyclerView`, you simply call `void setAdapter(final RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter adapter)`.

A couple more points of note:
* `RealmRecyclerView` supports **`LinearLayoutManager` only**
* `RealmRecyclerView` is *not* actually a `RecyclerView` subclass, it's a `RelativeLayout`. If you need access to the real `RecyclerView` or `LinearLayoutManager` instances for some reason, you can use the `getRecyclerView()` and `getLayoutManager()` methods
* When you're done using an adapter (such as when an Activity or Fragment is being destroyed), be sure to call its `close()` method to prevent any possible Realm instance leaks

## Features

<a name="drag-and-drop"/>
### Drag and Drop
Drag and drop can be a tricky feature to implement in the first place since your data model usually must have some field which keeps track of a position. Combine this with Realm's auto-updating nature, and you can quickly get lost in a sea of woe. Luckily, I've done most of the work for you ðŸ˜‰.

There are a few things which must be done to get drag and drop working properly. Keep in mind as you read through these steps that my preferred design choices may not line up exactly with yours; I've tried to keep this in mind to allow you maximum flexibility.

First, you need to enable drag and drop functionality. Currently the only way to do this is by adding the `rrvlDragAndDrop` attribute to your `RealmRecyclerView` in your layout and have it set to `true`:
```xml
<com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:rrvlDragAndDrop="true"
        app:rrvlDragStartTrigger="UserDefined"/>
```
You've likely noticed already that I have an extra attribute called `rrvlDragStartTrigger` here too. The value I've given it, `UserDefined`, is its default value, so you don't really need to add it if you don't wish to. We'll talk about its alternative value a bit later on.

Now we move back to your adapter. For drag and drop to work, you need to override the `onMove` method. You also need to add a bit more to your overridden `onBindViewHolder` method than it had before. These are the full methods from the sample app's [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class]:
```java
@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(final ItemVH holder, int position) {
    Item item = realmResults.get(position);
    holder.name.setText(item.name);
    // We set the unique ID as the tag on a view so that we will be able to get it in the onMove() method.
    holder.content.setTag(item.uniqueId);
    // Long click should start drag mode.
    holder.content.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
            startDragListener.startDragging(holder);
            return true;
        }
    });
}

@Override
public boolean onMove(RecyclerView.ViewHolder dragging, RecyclerView.ViewHolder target) {
    // Get positions of items in adapter.
    int draggingPos = dragging.getAdapterPosition();
    int targetPos = target.getAdapterPosition();

    // Get the unique IDs of the items from the tag that we set in onBindViewHolder().
    long draggingId = (long) ((ItemVH) dragging).content.getTag();
    long targetId = (long) ((ItemVH) target).content.getTag();

    // Determine if we can swap the items or if we need to actually move the item being dragged.
    if (Math.abs(draggingPos - targetPos) == 1)
        // Swapped.
        ItemDragHelper.swapItemPositions(draggingId, targetId);
    else if (draggingPos > targetPos)
        // Moved up multiple.
        ItemDragHelper.moveItemToBefore(draggingId, targetId);
    else
        // Moved down multiple.
        ItemDragHelper.moveItemToAfter(draggingId, targetId);

    return true;
}
```
Please note how I've ensured that the `onMove` method will have access to the value in each `Item`'s `uniqueId` field by storing that value as the tag of `content` View from the view holder.

I have to insist at this point that you look at some of the sample application's classes, I can't just dump the whole thing into this README file (But I will give you links).  
First, if you haven't done so already, take a quick look at [`Item` model class][Item Class].  
Then look at the [`ItemDragHelper` class][ItemDragHelper Class]. (It can be a bit daunting, though I've tried to comment it as heavily as possible.)

It's vitally important that you understand at least the *concept* of how the methods in `ItemDragHelper` work because you will need to implement some version of these concepts as well. If you're lucky then you may be able to adapt mine for your use. I won't detail it here, but if you want to read a bit more about my ordering scheme, [you can read this][Ordering Notes].

You'll notice that we have to handle three cases in the `onMove` method:
1. An item has been swapped with another item (AKA, dragged up or down one position)
2. An item has been moved up multiple positions
3. An item has been moved down multiple positions

You ***MUST*** handle **at least** the latter two cases for drag and drop to work smoothly (and honestly you *should* handle all three of them. While the "swap" could be treated the same as a "move", it is less performant to do so. Look at the difference between what I do in the `ItemDragHelper.swapItemPositions` method versus the `ItemDragHelper.moveItemTo*` methods).  
The reason for this is that when an item gets dragged further than what Android would consider a "swap" in a short enough period of time, it tends to batch those changes into a single "move".  
Don't make the same mistakes I did and waste your own time; handle all three cases.

You should also notice that nowhere in this code, be it the `onMove` method above or the methods in `ItemDragHelper`, do we call *any* of the `notify*Changed` methods. This is intended, because `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter` handles making the correct calls for you when it detects the changes you've made to your data (it relies on a `RealmChangeListener` to get these notifications, and if you wish to see how it decides which of the `notify*Changed` methods to call, take a look at the [`RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter` class][RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter Class]).

Now, getting back to that `rrvlDragStartTrigger` attribute. As I mentioned earlier, the value I gave it (`UserDefined`) is its default value, so you could actually remove that attribute and the example as given above would work exactly the same way.  
`UserDefined` simply means that nothing is going to get dragged anywhere unless you make the call to `startDragListener.startDragging(holder);` like we set up our long click listener to do in the example above.

The other value you can supply to `rrvlDragStartTrigger` is `LongClick`. It does exactly what it sounds like, it will (essentially) make the call to `startDragging` for you when you long click on a view. You still need to override the `onMove` method, but you wouldn't need that long click listener. I just did it the long way to show you how you'd do it if you *did* need to do more than allow a long click to start a drag any time.

<a name="multi-select"/>
### Multi-Select
Multi-select support is achieved through these methods on `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`:
* `boolean isSelected(int position)`
* `int getSelectedItemCount()`
* `List<T> getSelectedRealmObjects()`
* `void setSelected(boolean selected, int position)`
* `void toggleSelected(int position)`
* `void extendSelectionTo(int position)`
* `void selectAll()`
* `void clearSelections()`
* `void notifySelectedItemsChanged()`

Additionally, there are `void saveInstanceState(Bundle out)` and `void restoreInstanceState(Bundle in)` methods which will save and restore the currently selected positions.

You may make use of these how you wish. Here are some things to note, tips, etc:
* The methods which change the set of selected items all call the appropriate `notify*Changed()` methods for you, *but they do not actually modify the state of your views*. In your overridden `onBindViewHolder` method, you should make a call like `selectedPositions.contains(position);` to check and see if the item at that position is currently selected.
* `clearSelections` is automatically called if the adapter is notified by Realm that the data has changed. So you cannot, for example, maintain a set of selected items and do drag-and-drop (At some point I hope to re-work multi-select to remove this limitation)
* The `List` returned by `getSelectedRealmObjects` *is not* managed by Realm
* All of these methods are well-documented, any questions which remain should be answered by referring to their JavaDoc.

### Fast Scrolling
Having a fast scroller is extremely useful in some situations, and I've tried to make the implementation of it as easy as possible while leaving room for flexibility.

There are a few different attributes which are associated with the fast scrolling feature:
```xml
<com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:rrvlFastScrollEnabled="true"
        app:rrvlAutoHideFastScrollHandle="true"
        app:rrvlHandleAutoHideDelay="1000"
        app:rrvlUseFastScrollBubble="true"/>
```
Here's what the attributes (and their associated methods on `RealmRecyclerView`) do

| Attribute/Method | Method | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `rrvlFastScrollEnabled` | `setFastScrollEnabled` | Turns the fast scroller on. The default vertical scrollbar will be used if it's off.|
| `rrvlAutoHideFastScrollHandle` | `setAutoHideFastScrollHandle` | For if you want the fast scroller's handle to auto-hide after a delay instead of staying visible. False by default. |
| `rrvlHandleAutoHideDelay` | `setHandleAutoHideDelay` | For if you want the handle's auto-hide delay to be something other than the default 2000 milliseconds. |
| `rrvlUseFastScrollBubble` | `setUseFastScrollBubble` | For if you want the fast scroller to display a bubble next to the handle while using it to scroll. False by default. |

Other than the last one, these attributes are all you need to set if you want to have fast scrolling functionality.

To have the fast scroller show a bubble (akin to the stock Android Contacts app), you need to both set that last one to `true` as well as have your adapter override the `getFastScrollBubbleText(int)` method. Here's how the [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class] does it:
```java
@Override
public String getFastScrollBubbleText(int position) {
    return String.valueOf(realmResults.get(position).name.charAt(0));
}
```

That's it. It makes use of the fact that, as the adapter, it has direct access to the `RealmResults` object which is providing the data to populate the adapter.

#### Fast Scroller Customization
It's a pretty sure bet that the default colors for the fast scroller isn't the one you want (it's that hot pink accent color that you get when you create a new app project in Android Studio ðŸ˜‰).  
That, along with a number of other things, can be changed by overriding the following resources in the appropriate files in your project (I've included the defaults here):

* In `colors.xml`:  
```xml
<color name="rrvl_handle_inactive_color">#757575</color>
<color name="rrvl_handle_active_color">#FF4081</color>
<color name="rrvl_bubble_color">#FF4081</color>
<color name="rrvl_bubble_text_color">@android:color/white</color>
```
* In `dimens.xml`:  
```xml
<dimen name="rrvl_bubble_text_size">48sp</dimen>
<dimen name="rrvl_handle_margin_end">8dp</dimen>
<dimen name="rrvl_handle_padding_start">8dp</dimen>
```

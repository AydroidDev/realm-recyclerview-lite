# realm-recyclerview-lite

realm-recyclerview-lite is an implementation of a RecyclerView which supports Realm data.  
It is intended to be a slim library which fulfills the functionality requirements I have for my open source Android app [Minerva][Minerva]; no more, no less.  
However, I figured I might as well release it as a library in case others had similar use cases to mine.

If you just want to know what's new, [the changelog is here][CHANGELOG].

Please be sure to take a moment to look at the [Origin][Origin] section. You'll find a link to Thorben Primke's [realm-recyclerview][RRV] library, which this library is a heavily reworked derivative of.

## Installation
Including realm-recyclerview-lite in your app is pretty simple, just make sure that you have the following in your root `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

And then add this to your app's `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile ('com.bkromhout:realm-recyclerview-lite:{latest version}@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
}
```
Please note that at this time, realm-recyclerview-lite has been tested and is verified to work with **Realm 0.88.3**. Don't be afraid to try a newer version of Realm, just be sure to open an issue if you run into problems.

**realm-recyclerview-lite is compatible with Android API Levels >= 11.**

<a name="usage"/>
## Usage
Adding a `RealmRecyclerView` to your layout is simple:
```xml
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/recycler"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
</RelativeLayout>
```

The other important thing is to make sure that your adapter extends `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`. In keeping with the provided sample application, here is (a very slimmed down) version of an adapter:
```java
public class ItemAdapter extends RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter<Item, ItemAdapter.ItemVH> {

    public ItemAdapter(Context context, RealmResults<Item> realmResults) {
        super(context, realmResults, true, true, null);
        setHasStableIds(true);
    }

    @Override
    public long getItemId(int position) {
        return realmResults.get(position).uniqueId;
    }

    @Override
    public ItemVH onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        return new ItemVH(inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_card, parent, false));
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(final ItemVH holder, int position) {
        Item item = realmResults.get(position);
        holder.name.setText(item.name);
    }

    static class ItemVH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        @Bind(R.id.content)
        RelativeLayout content;
        @Bind(R.id.name)
        TextView name;

        public ItemVH(View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            ButterKnife.bind(this, itemView);
        }
    }
}
```

If you look at the actual [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class], you'll notice that there are many other things present in it. We'll get to those as we discuss the features, this is just a bare-bones implementation.

To set your adapter to a `RealmRecyclerView`, you simply call its `setAdapter` method.

A couple more points of note:
* `RealmRecyclerView` supports **`LinearLayoutManager` only**
* `RealmRecyclerView` is *not* actually a `RecyclerView` subclass, it's a `RelativeLayout`. If you need access to the real `RecyclerView` or `LinearLayoutManager` instances for some reason, you can use the `getRecyclerView` and `getLayoutManager` methods
* When you're done using an adapter (such as when an Activity or Fragment is being destroyed), be sure to call its `close` method to prevent any possible Realm instance leaks

## Features

<a name="drag-and-drop"/>
### Drag and Drop
Drag and drop can be a tricky feature to implement in the first place since your data model usually must have some field which keeps track of a position. Combine this with Realm's auto-updating nature, and you can quickly get lost in a sea of woe. Luckily, I've done most of the work for you ðŸ˜‰.

There are a few things which must be done to get drag and drop working properly. Keep in mind as you read through these steps that my preferred design choices may not line up exactly with yours; I've tried to keep this in mind to allow you maximum flexibility.

First, you need to enable drag and drop functionality. Currently the only way to do this is by adding the `dragAndDrop` attribute to your `RealmRecyclerView` in your layout and have it set to `true`:
```xml
<com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:dragAndDrop="true"/>
```

Now we move back to your adapter. For drag and drop to work, you need to override the `onMove` method. You also need to add a bit more to your overridden `onBindViewHolder` method than it had before. These are the full methods from the sample app's [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class]:
```java
@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(final ItemVH holder, int position) {
    Item item = realmResults.get(position);
    holder.name.setText(item.name);
    // We set the unique ID as the tag on a view so that we will be able to get it in the onMove() method.
    holder.content.setTag(item.uniqueId);
    // Long click should start drag mode.
    holder.content.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {
        @Override
        public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
            startDragListener.startDragging(holder);
            return true;
        }
    });
}

@Override
public boolean onMove(RecyclerView.ViewHolder dragging, RecyclerView.ViewHolder target) {
    // Get positions of items in adapter.
    int draggingPos = dragging.getAdapterPosition();
    int targetPos = target.getAdapterPosition();

    // Get the unique IDs of the items from the tag that we set in onBindViewHolder().
    long draggingId = (long) ((ItemVH) dragging).content.getTag();
    long targetId = (long) ((ItemVH) target).content.getTag();

    // Determine if we can swap the items or if we need to actually move the item being dragged.
    if (Math.abs(draggingPos - targetPos) == 1)
        // Swapped.
        ItemDragHelper.swapItemPositions(draggingId, targetId);
    else if (draggingPos > targetPos)
        // Moved up multiple.
        ItemDragHelper.moveItemToBefore(draggingId, targetId);
    else
        // Moved down multiple.
        ItemDragHelper.moveItemToAfter(draggingId, targetId);

    return true;
}
```
Please note how I've ensured that the `onMove` method will have access to the value in each `Item`'s `uniqueId` field by storing that value as the tag of `content` View from the view holder.

I have to insist at this point that you look at some of the sample application's classes, I can't just dump the whole thing into this README file (But I will give you links).  
First, if you haven't done so already, take a quick look at [`Item` model class][Item Class].  
Then look at the [`ItemDragHelper` class][ItemDragHelper Class]. (It can be a bit daunting, though I've tried to comment it as heavily as possible.)

It's vitally important that you understand at least the *concept* of how the methods in `ItemDragHelper` work because you will need to implement some version of these concepts as well. If you're lucky then you may be able to adapt mine for your use. I won't detail it here, but if you want to read a bit more about my ordering scheme, [you can read this][Ordering Notes].

You'll notice that we have to handle three cases in the `onMove` method:
1. An item has been swapped with another item (AKA, dragged up or down one position)
2. An item has been moved up multiple positions
3. An item has been moved down multiple positions

You ***MUST*** handle **at least** the latter two cases for drag and drop to work smoothly (and honestly you *should* handle all three of them. While the "swap" could be treated the same as a "move", it is less performant to do so. Look at the difference between what I do in the `ItemDragHelper.swapItemPositions` method versus the `ItemDragHelper.moveItemTo*` methods).  
The reason for this is that when an item gets dragged further than what Android would consider a "swap" in a short enough period of time, it tends to batch those changes into a single "move".  
Don't make the same mistakes I did and waste your own time; handle all three cases.

You should also notice that nowhere in this code, be it the `onMove` method above or the methods in `ItemDragHelper`, do we call *any* of the `notify*Changed` methods. This is intended, because `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter` handles making the correct calls for you when it detects the changes you've made to your data (it relies on a `RealmChangeListener` to get these notifications, and if you wish to see how it decides which of the `notify*Changed` methods to call, take a look at the [`RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter` class][RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter Class]).

<a name="long-click-drag-trigger"/>
#### Long Click as the Drag Trigger
In the example above I showed you how you could set up your `onBindViewHolder` method so that long clicking a view would trigger the start of a drag.  
If your use case is actually that simple, you can take a bit of a shortcut and get the *exact same functionality*. Here are the changes you'd make:
* In your layout, you add the `longClickTriggersDrag` attribute:  
```xml
<com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:dragAndDrop="true"
        app:longClickTriggersDrag="true"/>
```
* In your adapter, you don't need to explicitly call the `startDragListener.startDragging` method, so your `onBindViewHolder` method will now look like this:  
```java
@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(final ItemVH holder, int position) {
    Item item = realmResults.get(position);
    holder.name.setText(item.name);
    // We set the unique ID as the tag on a view so that we will be able to get it in the onMove() method.
    holder.content.setTag(item.uniqueId);
}
```

The reason why I showed it the long way was to demonstrate that the adapter can trigger a drag at any point (as long as it has a reference to the `RecyclerView.ViewHolder` which should start being dragged, that is).

<a name="multi-select"/>
### Multi-Select
Multi-select support is achieved through these methods on `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`:
* `boolean isSelected(int position)`
* `int getSelectedItemCount()`
* `List<T> getSelectedRealmObjects()`
* `void setSelected(boolean selected, int position)`
* `void toggleSelected(int position)`
* `void extendSelectionTo(int position)`
* `void selectAll()`
* `void clearSelections()`
* `void notifySelectedItemsChanged()`

Additionally, there are `void saveInstanceState(Bundle out)` and `void restoreInstanceState(Bundle in)` methods which will save and restore the currently selected positions.

You may make use of these how you wish. Here are some things to note, tips, etc:
* The methods which change the set of selected items all call the appropriate `notify*Changed()` methods for you, *but they do not actually modify the state of your views*. In your overridden `onBindViewHolder` method, you should make a call like `selectedPositions.contains(position);` to check and see if the item at that position is currently selected.
* `clearSelections` is automatically called if the adapter is notified by Realm that the data has changed. So you cannot, for example, maintain a set of selected items and do drag-and-drop (At some point I hope to re-work multi-select to remove this limitation)
* The `List` returned by `getSelectedRealmObjects` *is not* managed by Realm
* All of these methods are well-documented, any questions which remain should be answered by referring to their JavaDoc.

### Fast Scrolling
Having a fast scroller is extremely useful in some situations, and I've tried to make the implementation of it as easy as possible while leaving room for flexibility.

There are a few different attributes which are associated with the fast scrolling feature:
```xml
<com.bkromhout.rrvl.RealmRecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:fastScroll="true"
        app:autoHideFastScrollHandle="true"
        app:handleAutoHideDelay="1000"
        app:useFastScrollBubble="true"/>
```
Here's what the attributes (and their associated methods on `RealmRecyclerView`) do

| Attribute/Method | Method | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `fastScroll` | `setFastScroll` | Turns the fast scroller on. The default vertical scrollbar will be used if it's off.|
| `autoHideFastScrollHandle` | `setAutoHideFastScrollHandle` | For if you want the fast scroller's handle to auto-hide after a delay instead of staying visible. False by default. |
| `handleAutoHideDelay` | `setHandleAutoHideDelay` | For if you want the handle's auto-hide delay to be something other than the default 2000 milliseconds. |
| `useFastScrollBubble` | `setUseFastScrollBubble` | For if you want the fast scroller to display a bubble next to the handle while using it to scroll. False by default. |

Other than the last one, these attributes are all you need to set if you want to have fast scrolling functionality.

To have the fast scroller show a bubble (akin to the stock Android Contacts app), you need to both set that last one to `true` as well as have some class implement the [`BubbleTextProvider` interface][BubbleTextProvider Class], which defines one method, `getFastScrollBubbleText`. That method provides the position of the item in the adapter and expects the text which should be shown in the bubble in return.

In the sample application, I've chosen to have my [`ItemAdapter` class][ItemAdapter Class] implement this method like so:
```java
@Override
public String getFastScrollBubbleText(int position) {
    return String.valueOf(realmResults.get(position).name.charAt(0));
}
```

And then in the sample app's [`MainActivity` class][MainActivity Class], I pass the adapter to the `RealmRecyclerView` both as the adapter (of course) and as the bubble text provider at the end of    `onCreate`, like this:
```java
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
recyclerView.setBubbleTextProvider((ItemAdapter) adapter);
```

That's all there is to it! Note that while I chose to have the adapter implement the `getFastScrollBubbleText` method in my example, you could have some other object implement it if you so choose. Just remember that all you're given to work with is a position, so that object would need to have a copy of the same `RealmResults` that your adapter has in the first place.

<a name="handle-state-notifications"/>
#### Handle State Notifications
Having a fast scroller is great, but sadly Android's built-in classes, like `CoordinatorLayout`, don't really know about it, so in some cases you might need to do a bit of work yourself to make your views play nice.

A good example of this is when you have a `FloatingActionButton` on the screen with your `RealmRecyclerView`. While you *can* create a "behavior" which will cause the `FloatingActionButton` to automatically show/hide itself as you scroll the `RealmRecyclerView` up/down, that behavior class won't pick up on the scrolling done with the fast scroller, only normal scrolling ðŸ˜ž.

For my use case, I wanted the `FloatingActionButton` to hide itself when I grabbed the fast scroll handle, so I created the [`FastScrollHandleStateListener` interface][FastScrollHandleStateListener Class]. Here's how the sample's [`MainActivity`][MainActivity Class] implements it:
```java
@Override
public void onHandleStateChanged(FastScrollerHandleState newState) {
    switch (newState) {
        case VISIBLE:
            Log.d("MainActivity", "Handle visible.");
            break;
        case HIDDEN:
            Log.d("MainActivity", "Handle hidden.");
            break;
        case PRESSED:
            // Hide the FloatingActionButton.
            fab.hide();
            Log.d("MainActivity", "Handle pressed.");
            break;
        case RELEASED:
            Log.d("MainActivity", "Handle released.");
            break;
    }
}
```

While I've only used the `PRESSED` state to do something here, you can see that there are a total of four states which you'll be notified of.  
Note that the `VISIBLE` and `HIDDEN` states are only triggered if you have auto-hide on, and they're triggered *after the show/hide animation completes*.

<a name="fast-scroller-customization"/>
#### Fast Scroller Customization
It's a pretty sure bet that the default colors for the fast scroller isn't the one you want (it's that hot pink accent color that you get when you create a new app project in Android Studio ðŸ˜‰).  
That, along with a number of other things, can be changed by overriding the following resources in the appropriate files in your project (I've included the defaults here):

* In `colors.xml`:  
```xml
<color name="rrvl_handle_inactive_color">#757575</color>
<color name="rrvl_handle_active_color">#FF4081</color>
<color name="rrvl_bubble_color">#FF4081</color>
<color name="rrvl_bubble_text_color">@android:color/white</color>
```
* In `dimens.xml`:  
```xml
<dimen name="rrvl_bubble_text_size">48sp</dimen>
<dimen name="rrvl_handle_margin_end">8dp</dimen>
<dimen name="rrvl_handle_padding_start">8dp</dimen>
```
